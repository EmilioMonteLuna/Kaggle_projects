# Nuclear Energy Analysis


**Project Overview**

This project will analyze nuclear energy's role in global electricity generation, its safety compared to other energy sources, uranium production and pricing trends, and the operational characteristics of reactors and power plants. The analysis aims to provide actionable insights into nuclear energy's potential in achieving sustainable energy goals.Check out the original dataset here: [Nuclear Energy Datasets](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/alistairking/nuclear-energy-datasets/).**


# Objectives
1. Compare the safety of nuclear energy with other energy sources based on mortality rates.
2. Analyze trends in uranium purchase prices and production in the U.S.
3. Map global power plants and highlight nuclear facilities.
4. Explore global electricity generation trends with a focus on nuclear energy's share.
5. Investigate U.S. nuclear generating statistics and their evolution over time.
6. Examine reactor ownership and parent companies for market insights.

# Key Features of the Notebook
1. Time-series analysis of electricity generation and uranium pricing.
2. Geospatial visualization of global power plants.
3. Comparison of safety metrics across energy sources.
4. Predictive modeling for uranium prices or electricity generation.
5. Interactive visualizations for better storytelling.
